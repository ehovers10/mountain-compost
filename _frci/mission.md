## The problem of landfills

Landfills are well-known as smelly eyesores that take up vast tracts of land, but their broader environmental impact is often underappreciated. In the US, landfills are the second largest industrial source of methane gas emissions, and methane is approximately 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.{% note methane %}

The primary source of landfill methane is decomposing organic matter. When waste is dumped in a landfill, it is frequently encased in plastic bags and buried under fill dirt and other garbage. This blocks oxygen flow through the material, and naturally present bacteria set to work breaking down the material anaerobically. Methane is one of the byproducts of anaerobic decomposition.

It is essential that we curb this dangerous environmental destructor, and efforts are in place to make a dent in the problem. [New EPA regulations](https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/municipal-solid-waste-landfills-national-emission-standards
) on landfill gas emissions focus on capturing and controlling methane as it is emitted. One virtue of this approach is that the captured natural gas can potentially be put to use as an energy source.{% note landfillgas %} This is a valuable element of a global climate change mitigation portfolio, but it is essentially limited. Containment procedures should be supplemented with attempts to limit the amount of methane that landfills produce in the first place.

Luckily, organic matter needen't break down in such a dirty manner by necessity; methane emission is a consequence of the way in which organic matter is processed in landfills. A well-managed compost pile provides an oxygenated environment in which bacteria can flourish. They break down organic material quickly and efficiently, producing comparatively little methane emission.{% note netnegative %}

## Community-specific recipe

Successful composting depends upon the *recipe* used in constructing the compost pile. The goal in recipe development is to provide bacteria and other micro-decomposers with an environment in which they can thrive. This means providing them with adequate food, air, and water.{% note compost-basics %}

FRCI intends to focus on two waste streams in forming our compost recipe: Post-consumer (household and small business) food discards and beetle-kill wood chips. This choice of feedstocks is based on concern for efficient production of high-quality compost as well as sustainable choices for community waste management.{% note recipe %}

Residential food waste represents a large portion of food waste generally with 21% of the available food supply being lost at the consumer level.{% note foodloss %} By using residential food waste as our source of greens, we can cut into a major contributor to landfill problems and provide bacteria with a steady supply of nitrogen.

In the Front Range, water is a valuable commodity. A municipality can scarcely afford to dedicate water resources to managing waste. Thus, successful composting must take care to conserve the amount of water required to output quality, finished product. Household food waste is high in fruit and vegetable waste both in the form of kitchen trimmings and spoils. And in the Front Range, where many residents have lawns, grass clippings are (seasonally) prevalent. Happily, these ingredients are comparatively high in water content.{% note watercontent %} Using household organic waste as our greens source minimizes the amount of additional water that must be applied to the pile.

Also specific to the Front Range, beetle infestations in the forests have been a major difficulty over the last two decades. It has left tracts of standing dead trees in its wake, weakening the ecosystem and increasing its susceptibility to fire. Management of the forests has helped, but a result of this management is that there is a massive supply of wood that must be disposed of or utilized in some other way. Composting is a viable answer to the challenge of what to do with this wood. A healthy compost needs a steady supply of carbon-rich, bulky material like wood chips, and piles can reach temperatures in excess of 131 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature at which many wood-boring beetles are killed off. Thus, composting offers a way to put beetle-kill to use while minimizing its spread.

## Virtues of localism

One of the amazing gifts of the western United States is a wealth of open space. But this gift can also be a curse. For it allows us to clear our minds of concerns about our waste production by simply banishing it out of sight. But avoidance of an issue is not a solution, and waste production is a serious issue. There is a heavy environmental toll exacted by the policy of hauling waste outside of its production point for disposal. Efforts to manage waste closer to its source can have a large impact on the overall carbon cost of that waste.{% note truck-regs %}

The challenge is that few people are eager to keep their waste disposal efforts in their own back yard. It's a common conception that waste management is an unavoidably disgusting enterprise, but when it comes to organic waste, this simply isn't so. A well-managed compost system is a minimally-invasive, and ultimately valuable addition to a back yard. We want to demonstrate to our community that we ought not feel resigned to submitting our environment to the pressures of waste hauling. We feel that positive example is the best educational tool there is. By situating a clean, healthy composting operation within active an community zone, we can show our neighbors that composting is a viable waste management alternative and promote its implementation at a variety of scales.{% note parks-land %}

We believe that, if done right, an emphasis on local waste management can achieve an environmental and social impact trifecta of diverting waste from landfills, reducing the carbon footprint of waste management, and promoting further responsible waste management in our community.{% note nyccphbbr %}

## Environmental and social impact

Our guiding insight is that we can genuinely reduce landfill size and emissions by diverting potential food waste for composting. But the value of the proposal extends far beyond this single goal.

### Take waste problems and turns them into beautification solutions

City parks coordinators spend vast amounts of time and resources on yearly application of fertilizers and other treatments to public park spaces. Because these areas are indended for public use and tend to be high traffic, coordinators must work hard to balance the strength and safety of their land applications. Luckily, a valuable addition to a parks management portfolio is right under our noses. Finished compost is a soil amendment for use in flower garden spaces and as a top-dressing for lawn spaces. Compost is more than just a fertilizer. It contains a wide variety of nutrients and it offers greatly improved water retention. In addition, since its nutrients are mineralized, it allows for a slow release of nutrients as the plants need them. The fertilizing power of compost is thus spread out over multiple growing seasons, potentially reducing the amount of application needed over the years, and reducing excess chemical leaching into waterways.

### Further reduce emissions by reducing trucking demands

The EPA has recently released [new regulatory standards for the trucking industry](https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/climate/documents/420f16044.pdf). These regulations focus on making trucks lighter and their engines more fuel-efficient. But the simple fact is that trucking involves carbon emissions, either directly from internal combustion engines or indirectly from the power plants needed to produce electricity for electric engines. The only solution that genuinely eliminates carbon emission from trucking is to remove trucks from the road. Doing so is a principal consequence of a move towrad localism. It's not feasible for every person to manage their waste in their home, so waste transportation cannot be eliminated entirely. But the greater amount of the waste stream that we can manage locally, and the closer to the source we can bring that management, the more we cut into ancilary carbon emission production due to trucking.

### Reduce the amount of food that that goes to waste in the first place

Our community position would also give us the opportunity to educate the public about food waste in general and make inroads to meeting the [USDA Food Waste Challenge](http://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/index.htm), thereby alleviating the demand on waste management at the source.

## Scope of the initiative

Our vision is focused. Waste management in the US is an immense issue. We don't pretend to offer a solution to all the problems associated with waste in the US, or even within a single community. But we do believe that cutting into the problem and alleviating some of the stress on landfills and the atmosphere can have a genuine impact.

We also recognize that it is difficult for a single composting operation to manage all of a community's organic waste while also putting a premium on localism. A corrolary of localism is forming a *distributed* effort. A group of small scale composting facilities can collectively cut the massive problem of organic waste down to size.{% note distributed-effort %}

We don't see FRCI as displacing the need for large scale operations. There are large waste streams, such as landscaping waste, that we can't hope to deal with. But our movement is focused on development of a culture as much as it is waste management. One way to divert waste is to help people produce less of it in the first place.

We plan to emphasize intensity in our composting operation rather than extensiveness. By operating an impeccable composting operation, turning out high quality product, and publicly demonstrating the virtues of composting, we think that the value of the initiative will extend far beyond the actual tonnage we divert. We will promote household, community group, and other small scale composting operations that together keep waste management local.
