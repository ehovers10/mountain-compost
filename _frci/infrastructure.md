  A certain amount of infrastructure is needed to get a composting operation up and rolling. Much of the details are dependent on the operational scale, but this section provides a basic outline of the capital requirements, including both physical and human resources.

## Location needs

The *sine qua non* of composting is space. The fact is that waste management, even the kind that serves to turn it into a re-usable product, requires that waste to be put somewhere. And because composting involves active management of the waste, a greater amount of space is required to manage the same amount of waste compared to a landfill. But the value of composting is that input material is not destined to sit, unaltered, forever. The waste is transformed into a re-usable product, and it can be moved off site in a matter of months, freeing up space for new input material.

Our emphasis on localism requires that we have a space within or near the area that the waste is produced. Our preferred scale of operation allows us to keep the needed space small. We could perform the processing on 1-2 acres of space. Buffers in the form of trees or fencing are needed to minimize the visual and odor impact of the site on the surrounding area.

## Staffing needs

At an introductory scale, the operation could be administered by 4 full-time staff members. While job responsibilities are fluid, the envisioned job structure is as follows:

### Project Manager

Oversees the entirety of the project. Most hours are dedicated to administrative tasks such as liasing with financial backers and dealing with customer/community issues that arise. Also responsible for ensuring product quality by monitoring site operations and performing regular product tests.

### Collection and Distribution Manager

Runs the carting operation for the project. Devises and drives a regular truck route for servicing drop-off stations, collecting from contract households, and distributing finished compost. Also responsible for regular truck maintenance.

This manager would require staff assistance as the project scales up.

### Processing Manager

Runs the compost processing operation and mantains the composting site. Coordinates intake of raw organics and output of finished compost. Processes raw organic material and organizes compost piles on site. Maintains equipment needed for healthy composting.

This manager would require staff assistance on heavy processing days.

### Outreach and education Manager

Coordinates with local government, businessses, and community groups for outreach and education events. Staffs pop-up drop-off events. Devises and implements an on-site educational program including signage, volunteer events, and educational tours.

This manager would require staff assistance during peak outreach periods.

## Physical resource needs

This operation is highly dependent upon having the right tools for the job. Below is a categorized list of tools our operation will make use of. Some are requisite, some optional, and some scale dependent.
