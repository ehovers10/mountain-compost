  There are three components to the FRCI program operation. They are feedstock collection, the composting process, and distribution of the finished product. The nature of all three elements is informed by our chosen recipe ingredients and our emphasis on localism.

## Collection

There is a variety of models available for collecting feedstock materials for composting. Some of the models outlined below are scale dependent, and not all are feasible for collection of all feedstocks. But implementing a number fo different models will increase our visibility in the community and demonstrate the flexibility and convenience of food waste diversion.

All collection will be done in [32-gallon Toter Carts](http://www.toter.com/waste-haulers/product/two-wheel-organics-carts) with locking lids, rear wheels, and lift bars. These are durable receptacles, and the lids provide a barrier that keeps odors in and animals out. The wheels assist in transportation, and the lift bars make it easier to dump out full bins.

### Semi-permanent disposal stations

Always-available stations are set up in public spaces and serviced on a regular schedule (usually weekly). Servicing involves switching out used bins with empty ones, cleaning up the station, and monitoring/repairing station elements. The station itself consists of a Toter corral and some informational signage.{% note station-collage %}

### Pop-up drop-off stations

Temporarily available stations are set up at public events and offer residents an opportunity to drop-off food waste that they have been collecting at their home.

### Registered household pick-up

Contracts for regular pick-up of food waste are established with residential and small business customers.

### Private drop-off

Participants bring organic waste to our processing site for drop-off.

## Processing

Compost processing is the application of a compost recipe to input ingredients. Feedstocks are mixed and laid out in a pile with the end goal of creating a healthy environment for decomposition. The three primary decision points are: the recipe, the preparation method, and the pile structure.

### Recipe design

Our plan is to use household food scraps and wood chips as feedstocks. As an initial estimate, these would be combined in a 1:2 ratio by volume, although this is something that would be monitored and adjusted in the field.

Food scraps are high in nitrogen and water content, which allows us to minimize the amount of excess water that must be added to the pile. Wood chips offer both available carbon and bulking. In addition, because they break down more slowly, wood chips can be used for multiple rounds of composting. In this case, an additional, fine carbon source (such as wood shavings) may be needed to supplement the wood chips.

### Ingredients preparation

Our feedstocks are delivered to the site in 32-gallon tubs. They must be emptied from these tubs and adequately mixed to achieve a uniform mixture. Uniformity minimizes pockets of anaerobic activity within the pile, but homogeneity is not desireable; we want a variety of particle sizes and shapes so that the resulting pile has enough structure to allow air to flow to all parts of it. The dumping and mixing procedure is dependent upon the scale of the operation.

### Pile construction

The mixed feedstocks are piled up and left to allow the decomposers to work. Compost piles must be covered to control odor emissions and aerated to promote aerobic decompostion.

While there is some dependence on scale, we intend to build forced aeration, static piles. They will either be in partially enclosed bays, or in windrows, depending on site structure and equipment available. We will use a finished compost cover.

### Product testing

Decomposition will happen whether one puts any effort into it or not. But when you have a steady stream of waste to manage the compost pile must be monitored and maintained to promote efficiency and safety. Testing is all the more important when the intended application of the finished product involves comtact with humans. The [Process to Further Reduce Pathogens](http://bit.ly/2etFVPS) (PFRP) is a standard that compost piles must meet in order to provide a reasonable guarantee that most dangerous pathogens have been killed off in the process. The standard varies somewhat depending on the pile construction the site uses.

We will implement on-site quality testing procedures (such as [Solvita testing](https://solvita.com/) and [plant bioassays](http://sciencenetlinks.com/student-teacher-sheets/plant-bioassays/)). We will also send samples off to professional labs ([Soil Foodweb](http://www.soilfoodweb.com/Labs.html), [Soil Control Lab](http://www.compostlab.com/)) for third party input.

## Distribution

Once the compost is fully cured, it is ready to be distributed and applied as a soil amendment, weed/moisture-control mulch, or as a top-dressing for field maintenance or erosion control. Different uses for compost demand different grades of product. Grage can be measured in terms of *size* or *quality*.

We will allow registered customers to come to our processing site to pick up orders of compost, and we will also institute a delivery program, making use of the same transportation means we use for collection.

### Size control

Compost mulch is great for moisture control in tree beds. For this application a large proportion of woody material is a benefit. But for amending the soil of garden plots, the gardener wants a much finer product. To meet these demands, our finished compost must be screened to separate the undecomposed wood chips from the humus.

We will have just a single screen size, thus producing two grades of product: screened and unscreened. Screening is a time and labor intensive process. We will attempt to promote use of compost mulch in as many applications as possible, and we will leverage volunteer support for material that must be screened.

### Quality control

Soil amending and field maintenance involve significant human contact, so care must be taken to control for pathogens and heavy metals in the finished compost. Mulching and erosion control demand less quality control.

We will implement a single, uniform composting process, so we must tailor it to meet the most rigorous of our distribution demands -- applications that involve significant human contact. Ultimately, this might make it economically infeasible to produce compost for high-volume, low-quality applications like erosion control. Since our focus is on the community-building virtues of composting, we're satisfied with this potential limitation.

Some quality control can be implemented in the processing phase, but some of it will depend on the input ingredients. This is another reason to prefer food waste as an input source. It tends to carry less risk of dangerous contamination than other common greens such as human and animal waste. Depending on our scale, we may have to restrict meat from our accepted food waste as a quality control mechanism.
