The Front Range Compost Initiative (FRCI) is an attempt to bring waste full circle. We focus on two major waste streams -- post-consumer food waste and trees subject to beetle infestation -- and operate a composting site with the goal of keeping this waste out of landfills. The result is more open space and less carbon emission from poorly managed organic waste.

A commitment to *localism* is crucial to the program. A basic principle of the initiative is that if waste is created in the community, it should be managed there. This needn't be viewed as a burden on a community because organic waste can be managed in a clean, aesthetically responsible way. If done right, local waste management has a three-fold environmental and social impact: *diverting waste from landfills*, *reducing the carbon footprint of waste management*, and *promoting further responsible waste management in our community*.

Compost is our starting point, but it isn't the full picture. We also engage and educate community members on composting through volunteer and outreach programming. And we provide a wide portfolio of environmental impact mitigation services from reducing the carbon output due to waste carting to helping folks earn environmental credits for returning carbon to the soil and improving its water retention. The circle is closed when the finished compost is returned to the community for beautification efforts.

This proposal outlines the details of the project. It includes descriptions of the major operation phases, a set of models for how the operation will be administered, and capital investment requirements to make the project a success.
