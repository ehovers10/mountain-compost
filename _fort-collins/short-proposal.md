We would like to help Fort Collins meet the **Culture Change** and **Compostable Organics out of Landfills** priorities on its [*Road to Zero Waste Vision*](http://www.fcgov.com/zerowaste/). We would do so by operating a community composting site located within city limits that accepts household and small business food scraps. We would also develop outreach and educational programs on composting, food waste reduction, and general environmental considerations.
